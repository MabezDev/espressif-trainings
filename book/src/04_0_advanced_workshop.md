# Advanced Workshop

In this course we're going to dive deeper into topics that are embedded-only and/or close to the hardware, especially focussing on lower level i/o. Other then in the first part, we'll not just use the higher level abstractions where for example something like pin configurations are hidden away. You'll learn how to configure them yourself. You're also going to learn how to write directly into registers and how to find out which register is needed in the first place. 

This part consists of three exercises: 

In the first one you'll learn how to handle a button interrupt, in the second you'll read sensor values from sensors via the IÂ²C bus. Once you have used the drivers we have prepared, you'll learn how to get started writing your own. This is a necessary skill as Rust drivers are usually not provided by manufacturers. 

## Preparations
We're going to assume you have completed the entire [preparations](./02_preparations.md) chapter and are familiar with the responsibilities of the different components TODO LINK of the `esp-rs` ecosystem.
