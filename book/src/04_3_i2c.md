# I²C

## Introduction

The I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol allows multiple peripheral chips to communicate with one or more controller chips. Many devices can be connected to the same I2C bus and messages can be send to a particular device by specifying its I2C address. The protocol requires two signal wires and can only be used for short distance communications within one device. 

One of the signal lines is for data (SDA) and the other is for the clock signal (SCL). An I2C transaction consists of one or more messages. Each message begins with a start symbol. A message is either write or read, indicated by the next bit in the row. Following this comes the actual message in form of bytes. The message ends with a stop symbol. The clock signal rises and falls in a specified frequency.

## Read temperature & humidity using existing crates

generate the relevant docs using the following command:

Define two pins, one as SDA and one as SCL. Use them to instantiate an Instance of the I2C peripheral. 

Using the existing driver crates, make an instance of each sensor, passing the I2C instance into them. 




## Write your own I²C driver for the IMU

We're not going to write an entire driver, merely the first step: the `hello world` of driver writing: reading the serial number of the driver. 

Register Address where the serial number is:
WHOAMI = 0x0F
The serial number:

write_read
